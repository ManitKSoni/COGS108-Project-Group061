    "We realized that there was a lack of contextual information about the descriptive phrases in our data set (e.g. their referential properties to different candidates). Our existing data set uses hour and date to indicate the timeframe in which phrases were used, so our original plan to use time to bind descriptive phrases to candidates wouldn't have worked. Knowing a descriptive phrase was used within an hour of a given candidates name isn't a close enough time seperation to confidently determine if that phrase was used to describe said candidtate. To resolve this complication, we decided to assemble a novel data set via web scraping that would provide the actual proximity (i.e. word seperation) between descriptive phrases and candidate's names within a sentence instead to answer our research questions."

    "Moving forward, we determined that we'll need to scrape different outlet's political archives from 2015 to 2016 covering the 2016 presidential election to assemble a new data set we can use to accurately answer our research questions. After assembling and cleaning this sentence-based data set to only include sentences mentioning the candidates by name, we'll need to create an algorithm to determine which descriptors are referring to which candidate within a given sentence. This data will be sorted by news organization and date. Finally, these descriptors will be compared to positive and negative word dictionaries we'll assemble to determine their valence. With this organized table based on our web-scraped data set, we should be able to determine any inter-news-outlet differences  in the valence of their descriptive coverage of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton during the 2016 general elections.\n"
