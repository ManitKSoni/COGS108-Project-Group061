Ethics and privacy
There should not be any privacy concerns with the data used as it will be taken from news articles and coverage that is already available to the public. There may be potential biases in the dataset if it doesn't use diverse sources or overly relies on select sources. This is because of the potential political biases of news outlets. We control for this by having variables for the specific news organization. Thus, we will have multiple perspectives on the coverage instead of a combined media perspective. There may also be an unintended use of the data to promote narratives of why the coverage is directed the way it is. Our research is specifically meant to look for correlations of positive/negative coverage of candidates and does not prove any bias towards/against candidates.
 
One thing we have to worry about in terms of ethics is that certain news outlets have certain policies to uphold. For example, FOX news probably has policies on what their hosts can talk about and how they should present the information to the public. If we do not account for this fact, it can raise ethical issues because it can screw our data against a particular news outlet. News outlets might purposely say certain words for the “clickbait” aspect, and not truly representative about what they are showcasing.
